          <h1><u>Grace's About Me Web Page</u></h1>  
          <p>My name is <b>Grace</b> and I grew up in Pennsylvania. However, I have been attending school in Delaware for most of my life. I went to Ursuline for nine years, then came to Padua for high school. I am currently a sophomore.</p>
          <p>I used to be a runner in elementary school, then switched to field hockey and lacrosse in middle school. I used to do cheer and currently play lacrosse for Padua. My position in lacrosse is attack. Finally, I used to dance. </p> 
          <p>Some random facts about me are that I am left handed, but only write with my left hand. My favorite movie is <i>Forrest Gump</i>. I have traveled to Paris and London. I have also been to Bermuda and Puerto Rico. I hope to return to those places very soon.</p>
